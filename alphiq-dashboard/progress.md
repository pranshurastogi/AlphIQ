# AlphIQ Dashboard â€” Project Progress Report

_Last updated: June 2025_

---

## Overview

AlphIQ is a comprehensive analytics dashboard for the Alephium blockchain, featuring real-time network stats, wallet profiling, contract decoding, gamified onchain scoring, quests, and more. This report summarizes the current state of features: implemented, in progress, and pending/planned, based on the codebase and documentation.

---

## 1. Implemented Features

### Core Dashboard & UI
- **Modern, Responsive UI:** Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. Modular, accessible, and visually appealing.
- **Global Layout:** Header (wallet connect, navigation), footer, and theming (`app/layout.tsx`, `components/TopBar.tsx`, `components/Footer.tsx`).

### Live Network Stats
- **LiveStats Component:** Fetches and displays real-time Alephium network data (block height, TPS, health, etc.) using custom hooks (`components/LiveStats.tsx`, `hooks/useNetworkStats.ts`).

### Wallet Profiling
- **WalletProfiler:** Connect/view any Alephium wallet, see balances, recent transfers, and activity charts (`components/WalletProfiler.tsx`, `hooks/useAddressInfo.ts`, `hooks/useAddressTransactions.ts`).
- **Streak Tracking:** Visualizes login streaks and activity (`components/StreakCard.tsx`).

### Onchain Score & Gamification
- **OnchainScoreCard:** Summarizes wallet's onchain score, XP, streak, and multipliers (`components/OnchainScoreCard.tsx`).
- **Score Calculation:** Sophisticated scoring logic based on balance, transaction history, and account age (`lib/score.ts`).
- **Score History Chart:** Interactive chart of score progression (`components/score-history-chart.tsx`).
- **Achievements & Badges:** Achievements for actions like first transaction, contract deployment, referrals, etc. (see `app/onchain-score/page.tsx`).
- **Score Multipliers:** Visualizes active and upcoming multipliers (streaks, weekend boosts, etc.) (`components/score-multiplier.tsx`).
- **Leaderboard:** Ranks wallets by score, XP, and achievements (`components/leaderboard.tsx`).

### Quests & Challenges
- **Quest of the Day:** Daily/weekly quests, submission forms, and status tracking (`components/QuestOfDay.tsx`, `app/quests/page.tsx`).
- **Quest List:** All active quests, with partner info, categories, and user submissions.
- **XP Rewards:** Completing quests/achievements grants XP and badges.

### Contract & Token Analytics
- **Contract Decoder:** Decodes and displays smart contract data, including state and bytecode (`components/ContractDecoder.tsx`).
- **Token Distribution Card:** Visualizes token distribution among holders (`components/TokenDistributionCard.tsx`, `hooks/useTokenDistribution.ts`).

### Blog & Updates
- **BlogFeed:** Fetches and displays latest blog posts or project updates (`components/BlogFeed.tsx`, `hooks/useBlogPosts.ts`).

### Miscellaneous
- **UI Primitives:** Rich set of reusable UI components (`components/ui/`).
- **Theming:** Custom color palette, dark/light support (`tailwind.config.ts`, `components/theme-provider.tsx`).

## 2. In Progress

- **Onchain AI Analyzer:** Summarizes wallet activity using LLMs (see `components/OnchainAIAnalyzer.tsx`).
  - _Status:_ Core logic implemented, but may need further refinement, error handling, and UI polish.
- **Quest Submission File Upload:** File upload for quest proof is present, but may need backend/file storage integration for production.
- **XP/Level System:** XP bar and level-up logic are present, but may need backend persistence and more dynamic updates.
- **Score/Quest/XP Backend Sync:** Some features rely on Supabase; further backend integration/testing may be ongoing.

---

## 3. Pending / Planned Features

- **Token Flow Analyzer:** Planned in README, but no dedicated component found. Would visualize token movements between wallets.
- **Onchain Alerts:** Alerts for large transfers, new contracts, or unusual activity are stubbed in `app/page.tsx` but not fully implemented.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Deeper analytics (e.g., DeFi protocol usage, governance participation) could be expanded.
- **User Settings/Profile:** No dedicated user profile/settings page found.
- **Mobile Optimization:** UI is responsive, but further mobile-specific optimizations may be needed.
- **Testing & QA:** No explicit test files or coverage found; recommend adding tests.
- **Documentation:** Code comments and developer docs could be expanded for easier onboarding.

---

## 4. Recommendations / Next Steps

- **Complete In-Progress Features:** Finalize Onchain AI Analyzer, file upload for quest proofs, and backend XP/score sync.
- **Implement Token Flow Analyzer:** Add a dedicated component/page for token flow visualization.
- **Enhance Onchain Alerts:** Make alerts dynamic and actionable.
- **Expand Analytics:** Add more metrics (DeFi, governance, security, etc.).
- **User Profile/Settings:** Allow users to manage their profile, preferences, and see their quest/achievement history.
- **Testing:** Add unit/integration tests for core logic and components.
- **Documentation:** Expand developer and user documentation.
